## 🎮 What Is a Hades Cheat?

A **Hades cheat** is a trainer, save file modifier, or modded tool that gives you access to game-breaking powers. While the game already has an optional *God Mode*, external cheats let you do way more:

* Instantly max resources like Titan Blood and Diamonds
* Enable full invincibility and damage boosts
* Unlock every weapon and aspect
* Spawn god-tier boons from the start
* Break the run cycle with zero death penalties

Basically, cheat mode = full mythological domination 💀
